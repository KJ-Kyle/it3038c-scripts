# Project 3 

For Project 3, I created a scrypt that searches for breweries in a given city in alphabetical order

<h2>
  How To Use
</h2> 
<p>  
 To start simply import these libraries: 

```python
pip install flask
pip install requests
```

 To start, run the "start.py" file. This will create a locl server on port 5000
 If no errors are thrown and the scrypt is still running, you're good to go <br>
  
 Now in a browser, go to http://localhost:5000<br>
 Once there, Two options will appear in the tab. The first one is for the city that you want to search and the second is for the number of breweries want.<br>
</p>  
<h3> 
  Example
</h3> 
<p>
  Put "Cincinnati" in the first box and "5" in the second (minus the ") <br>
  the next page should show this:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>13 Below Brewery - micro - 7391 Forbes Rd</li>
  <li>Bad Tom Smith Brewing - micro - 4720 Eastern Ave</li>
  <li>Big Ash Brewing Company - planning - None</li>
  <li>Boston Beer Co - DBA Samuel Adams Brewing Co - regional - 1625 Central Pkwy</li>
  <li>Brink Brewing Company - micro - 5905 Hamilton Ave </li>
</ul>

<h2>
  Installation
</h2>

<p>
  Two external libraries were used to create this scrypt, clipboard and wikipedia 
</p>
<p>
  To install these libraries, simply pip install them 
</p>

```bash
pip install wikipedia
pip install clipboard
```
