# Project 2 

For Project 2 I created a scrypt in poython that will search the contents of your clip board in wikipedia 

<h2>
  How To Use
</h2> 
<p>  
 To make the code work, simply start the scrypt. 
 If no errors are thrown and the scrypt is still running, you're good to go 
  
 To initiate a search, simply type "lu!" and the term you would like to look up and the scrypt will open a .txt file with what it finds.
</p>  
<h3> 
  Example
</h3> 
<p>
 Here is an example of a search term
</p>

```python
lu!Cincinnati
```

<h3>
  NOTE!
</h3>
<p>
  Anyhting that does not hav the "lu!" in front of it will not be searched 
</p>

<h3>
   Stopping the scrypt
</h3>
<p>
If at any point you wish to stop the scrypt, simply coppy "stp" and the code with automatically stop
</p>

<h2>
  Installation
</h2>

<p>
  Two external libraries were used to create this scrypt, clipboard and wikipedia 
  To install these libraries, simply pip install them 
</p>

```bash
pip install wikipedia
pip install clipboard
```
