This code simply takes in the drive name the user whishes to get the amount of free drive space and returns the
	amount of disk space availible in either Kb, Mb, Gb, or Tb depending on the amount of free space availible

After running the code, it will ask the user to "input the drive name (ex. C:\): " 
After putting in the drive name, it will return the amount of free space 
	Note: if the user submits anything other then an existing drivve name, the code with say "That drive does not exist" 
		and will ask them to resubmit the drive name until it gets an existing drive name

Code was borrowed from
